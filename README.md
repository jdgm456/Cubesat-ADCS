# Cubesat-ADCS
Repository documents the development of a closed-loop simulation for a CubeSat-scale Attitude Determination &amp; Control System (ADCS) using Simulink. The project focuses on modeling realistic perturbed dynamics and implementing Kalman filter-based sensor fusion for attitude estimation. Initial control strategies include PID control, then LQR later on
